Hey there, Attila!

Thank you for letting me review your code!  I think your code is short and sweet. It looks efficient and I could follow along easily.

Your HTML:
Straight forward and concise

Your CSS:
Excellent uses of your selectors. Again, straight forward.

Your JS:
Looks good, as well. Later, if you wanted to clean up your code, then maybe delete the commented out console log stuff, but other than that. It looks good.

Overall, I didn't see any redundancies in your code. Great job! Keep it up!

Hey Summer!

Thanks for reviewing my forum page. I have cleaned up the js code and updated my repository. Please check it out now. You may want to update all the files to be sure to get all the changes.

Thanks!
